ðŸ›’ MERN Stack E-Commerce App (In Progress)
I'm currently developing a full-stack E-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The app is designed to serve as a dynamic meal marketplace, allowing users to:

Browse and search for products

Add items to a shopping cart

Register and log in to their accounts

Complete secure purchases

ðŸ”§ Features Under Development
Full CRUD functionality for managing products and user data

User authentication and session management

Integration of external APIs for enhanced functionality

Seamless frontendâ€“backend communication through a secure RESTful API

Project Status
This project is a work in progress. Iâ€™m uploading new code daily as I build out features and refine the application.

Stay tuned for updates!
